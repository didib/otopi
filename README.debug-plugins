otopi - debug plugins
=====================

The optional package otopi-debug-plugins provides plugins that can help
debug otopi-based tools.

wait_on_error
-------------
Activated by setting in the system environment OTOPI_WAIT_ON_ERROR=1.

If activated, each occurrence of an [ERROR] message triggers a prompt:

    Press Enter to continue.

force_fail
----------
Activated by setting in the system environment OTOPI_FORCE_FAIL_STAGE.
The value set there should be a name of one of the STAGE_* constants
in plugin.Stages .

Optionally can set priority for the failure by setting also
OTOPI_FORCE_FAIL_PRIORITY to one of the PRIORITY_* constants in the
same class.

If activated, causes a RuntimeError at the specified stage and priority.

test_failure
------------
Always active, if installed. Runs some commands to help debug failures.
